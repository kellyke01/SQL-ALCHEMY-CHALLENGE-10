# SQL-ALCHEMY-CHALLENGE-10

In this challenge I was able to find the most recent date in the dataset, after first being able to connect to the database.
I was able to reflect the data into three separate classes and them link my python to the database.
Successfully I closed the session at the end of the notebook.

I was able to build the Flask application to include:
  - a precipitation route,
  - a stations route
  - and a tobs route
  - while also making them all loop through the last year in the database.
There is also a start route and a start/end route that accepts the parameteres from the URL.

Everything was able to run for me with no errors!


I was able to use material and videos provided by Dr. A to help me successfully navigate through all of the material needed
for this challenge.
